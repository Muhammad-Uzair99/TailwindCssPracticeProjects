## Introduction

FreeCodeCamp's Responsive Web Design Certification covers several front-end development topics including HTML, CSS, CSS Grid, CSS Flexbox, and responsive design principles. As part of the certification, students complete a series of five projects to demonstrate their understanding of these topics.

This repository recreates those projects using Tailwind CSS, a utility-first CSS framework that makes it easy to create responsive and customized user interfaces. By recreating the projects with Tailwind CSS, students can practice their front-end development skills while also learning a new framework.

## Projects
